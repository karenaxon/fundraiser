          <p class="lead text-muted">If you have small children, who you want to sit next to, keep that in mind when booking your airfare. Some airlines charge you a fee for the ability to select your seats. We saw frantic parents, both at the airport and in the plane, begging people to switch seats with them because their seat assignments were far from their small children's.
          </p>
          <p class="lead text-muted">For this trip, we flew out of Seatac Friday morning and returned late Saturday; a total of 9 days and 8 nights. My approach was to book the airfare first (I had to take advantage of a deal) and then to figure out the number of days that we would spend at each park and I based that off the activities that we were interested
          </p>
          <p class="lead text-muted">We flew into Salt Lake City, rented a car and drove down to Las Vegas. Renting a car for a whole week seemed like a good deal. However, having the rental car for an additional day and a half was expensive because single day rentals are higher. Also, returning the rental car to a different location incurred a $300 fee. We rented the car through Costco and it was the same amount as if we had rented it directly from the vendor. However, with Costco you get a second driver added to the car rental for free. Depending on the vendor, that is about a $25 daily value.
          </p>
          <p class="lead text-muted">Before you leave home, make sure you get a map of Utah and familiarize yourself with it. Cell phone reception was very limited and some of the main highways were under construction when we went. Google maps routed us through some old highways (one didn't even have a median strip) which took us through some ghost like towns (no people anywhere, no coffee stands!). Sometimes we didn't see a car for hours.
          </p>
          <p class="lead text-muted">Driving three and a half hours from Salt Lake City to Moab felt pretty long. However, if you don't want to make that drive, you can now fly from Denver, CO into the Canyonlands Field airport (CNY); which is located just outside of Moab. From the airport you could Uber into Moab to rent a car.
          </p>
          <p class="lead text-muted">If it is cheaper for you, you could do this trip backwards; fly into Las Vegas and out of Salt Lake City to come home. The Everett airport is now open and it could be an option as well. We could have flown out of Everett and into Salt Lake City but, at the time, there weren't any returning flights from Las Vegas available. Additionally, long-term off-site parking wasn't available yet at the Everett airport.
          </p>
          <p class="lead text-muted"><strong>Please remember to make your long-term parking reservation at your favorite off-site parking garage. It is rare to find openings nowadays without a reservation specially during holidays and school breaks.
