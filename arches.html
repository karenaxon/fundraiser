          <p class="lead text-muted">We arrived to the Arches Visitor Center fifteen minutes prior to it closing on a Friday evening. The park itself was still open so we decided to check out the arches that are close to the park's entrance. It turned out to be one of the best times to do so since everyone else was leaving for the day. The road that leads in and out of the park is a windy one lane road and during the busy summer times, it could take a while to go from arch to arch.
          </p>
          <p class="lead text-muted">We stayed at the <a href="https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/cnyms-springhill-suites-moab/" target="_blank">SpringHill Suites by Marriott</a>, which is on the outskirts of Moab and only five minutes from the entrance to the park. It is adjesent to the Fairfield Inn & Suites and they share several fun swimming pools and hot tubs. On the weekend, the place was lively. The breakfast had vegan, gluten and dairy free options. The accomodations were great! This hotel is only about 5 minutes away from town. However, the highway is a one lane road and the speed limit is about 30 miles per hour through town. Keep that in mind if you are going during the busy summer months and are planning on being at the park at a certain time.
          </p>
          <p class="lead text-muted">Outdoor activities abound at Moab. A place to schedule tours and activies is the <a href="https://www.moabadventurecenter.com/" target="_blank">Moab Adventure Center</a>.
           We went on a four hours plus mountain bike tour of the Klondike Bluff. It was strenuous with an immediate 700 feet elevation gain and a never ending downhill ride on slickrock in the way back. We also explored other trails with our tour guide, which put us on terrains that look from out of this world. The tour was through <a href="https://rimtours.com/" target="_blank">Rim Tours</a> and our guide (Noel) was excelent!
          </p>
          <p class="lead text-muted">Moab has everything that you can possibly need. The grocery story is big (but I didn't see any gf bread) and there are lots of restaurants. Utah is a Mormon state and all alcohol is sold at liquior stores. I ordered a margarita at a Mexican restaurant and I thought that the Tequila had inadvertaly been left out. The restaurant's manager shared that the amount of liquor that they are allowed to use in mixed alcholic drinks is very little so order your drinks wisely!
          </p>

          <p class="lead text-muted">We ate at the <a href="https://themoabbrewery.com/about.html" target="_blank">Moab Brewery</a> and I ordered a burger wrapped in lettuce with a garden salad as my gf meal. This is a popular spot and there was a long wait. Their homemade gelato is sold at the gear store and is really good. There are gf, dairy free and (I believe) vegan options. We went back a second night for it! However, our favority restaurant in Moab was <a href="https://www.98centermoab.com/" target="_blank">98 Center</a>. The food here is fresh, locally sourced and simply amazing! The gf and vegan options abound. The restaurant is very small and intimate. If you go at lunch or dinner time, the wait might be a long one but totally worth it.
